# image-segmentation-unet
Implementation of U-Net for semantic image segmentation on the CARLA self-driving car dataset. The project demonstrates pixel-wise classification to accurately detect roads, cars, pedestrians, and more.
# ðŸ§  Image Segmentation with U-Net | CARLA Self-Driving Car Dataset

This repository contains my implementation of **U-Net** for **semantic image segmentation**.  
The model predicts a **label for every pixel** in an image from the **CARLA self-driving car dataset**, enabling precise detection of roads, cars, pedestrians, and other objects.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Semantic image segmentation is an advanced **computer vision** technique where every pixel in an image is classified into a predefined category.  
Unlike **object detection** (which draws bounding boxes), semantic segmentation produces a **mask** for each object, giving pixel-perfect results.

This project focuses on:
- Building a **U-Net** architecture from scratch.
- Training the model on the **CARLA self-driving car dataset**.
- Predicting segmentation masks for real-world driving images.
- Using **sparse categorical crossentropy** for pixel-wise classification.
